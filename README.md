# Global ESG Trend Analysis: GDP, Population, and CO₂ Emissions Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) trends by examining the relationship between economic growth (GDP), population growth, and fossil CO₂ emissions over time. The goal is to evaluate global sustainability progress and carbon efficiency using data analysis and visualization techniques.

This project demonstrates core ESG data analyst skills including data cleaning, validation, ESG metric calculation, trend analysis, and dashboard development.

## Objectives

* Collect and clean global sustainability and economic data
* Validate data accuracy and ensure consistency
* Analyze trends in GDP, population, and CO₂ emissions
* Calculate key ESG indicators such as carbon intensity
* Identify sustainability patterns and environmental risk indicators
* Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains yearly global data with the following variables:

* Year
* GDP Real (USD)
* GDP Growth (%)
* GDP Per Capita
* World Population
* Population Change (%)
* Fossil CO₂ Emissions (tons)
* CO₂ Emissions Change (%)
* CO₂ Emissions Per Capita
* Population Density

Source: Global macroeconomic and environmental indicators dataset.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – data cleaning and analysis
* Google Colab – data processing environment
* SQL (SQLite) – data validation and querying
* Power BI – dashboard creation and visualization
* Microsoft Excel – data inspection and validation

## ESG Metrics Calculated

The following key ESG indicator was calculated:

**Carbon Intensity**
Carbon Intensity = CO₂ Emissions / GDP

This metric measures environmental efficiency and indicates how much carbon is emitted per unit of economic output.

---

## Key Insights

* Global GDP has increased significantly over time, reflecting economic growth.
* CO₂ emissions have also increased, but at varying rates across years.
* Carbon intensity has shown gradual improvement, indicating better carbon efficiency.
* Population growth contributes to increased environmental pressure.
* A noticeable emissions drop occurred during 2020 due to reduced economic activity.

## Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* GDP trend analysis
* CO₂ emissions trend analysis
* Carbon intensity trend analysis
* Population growth visualization
* Interactive time-based analysis
